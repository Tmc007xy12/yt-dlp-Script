# yt-dlp-Script

This is the original yt-dlp for more info all i am providing is a simple script for it and the necessary files to get you going

https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp

This is just a yt-dlp download script with simple commands, but it works.
I might be adding more features to this so that you can have more features.
for this to fully work you need to extract the ffmpeg in 7-zip then you can fun the cmd script 

Please note that when using this porgram it will be advisted to use a VPN for it, because you could get blocked from sites.
